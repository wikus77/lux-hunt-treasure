## 1. INTRODUCTION TO PULSE ENERGY

Pulse Energy is the regenerating resource that powers player actions within M1SSION™. This system creates meaningful resource management decisions while ensuring that all players—regardless of spending—can engage with the core gameplay experience.

The Pulse Energy system represents a careful balance between accessibility and monetization, providing free players with sufficient resources for meaningful play while offering paying players convenience without competitive advantage.

---

## 2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Energy as Game Currency

Pulse Energy serves multiple game design purposes:

**Session Pacing**
Energy depletion naturally limits session length, preventing burnout and encouraging healthy play patterns.

**Strategic Depth**
Limited energy requires players to make meaningful decisions about action prioritization.

**Engagement Retention**
Energy regeneration creates reasons to return, maintaining regular engagement.

**Monetization Foundation**
Optional energy purchases provide revenue without pay-to-win mechanics.

### 2.2 Design Philosophy

The system follows these design principles:

**Abundance for Patience**
Free players who wait will always have sufficient energy for their next session.

**Acceleration, Not Advantage**
Paying players can play more frequently but cannot achieve outcomes unavailable to free players.

**Transparent Mechanics**
All energy calculations are visible and predictable to players.

**Generous Defaults**
Base regeneration rates ensure casual players rarely experience energy constraints.

## 3. ENERGY MECHANICS

### 3.1 Energy Properties

Pulse Energy has these fundamental properties:

**Current Energy**
The amount of energy currently available for use.

**Maximum Capacity**
The upper limit of storable energy.

**Regeneration Rate**
The speed at which energy recovers over time.

**Overflow Behavior**
How the system handles energy when at capacity.

### 3.2 Capacity Determination

Maximum energy capacity is determined by:

**Base Capacity**
Starting capacity for all players (100 energy units).

**Level Bonus**
Additional capacity gained per player level (+5 per level).

**Subscription Bonus**
Premium subscribers receive enhanced capacity (+50).

**Achievement Bonus**
Specific achievements may grant permanent capacity increases.

**Event Bonus**
Temporary capacity increases during special events.

### 3.3 Regeneration Mechanics

Energy regenerates according to:

**Base Rate**
Standard regeneration of 1 energy unit per 2 minutes.

**Level Enhancement**
Higher levels may receive slightly faster regeneration.

**Subscription Enhancement**
Premium subscribers regenerate at 1 unit per 90 seconds.

**Bonus Periods**
Special events or daily windows may offer accelerated regeneration.

### 3.4 Overflow Handling

When energy would exceed capacity:

**Standard Behavior**
Excess energy is lost; regeneration pauses at capacity.

**Bonus Energy**
Granted bonuses may temporarily exceed capacity (stored separately).

**Purchase Energy**
Purchased energy may exceed capacity with extended storage time.
