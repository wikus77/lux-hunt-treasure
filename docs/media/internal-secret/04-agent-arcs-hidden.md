## 1. PROTAGONIST SECRETS

### 1.1 Maya Torres/Santos — Full Secret Arc

**Public Story:**
Former athlete enters treasure hunt, discovers mysterious AI, becomes agent of truth.

**Hidden Story:**
Maya was engineered. Her parents were MISSION ONE scientists who modified her genetics to be compatible with entity consciousness. Her "career-ending injury" was sabotage by the organization to redirect her to the hunt at the right age.

**Secret Timeline:**
- 1995: Maya's parents part of MISSION ONE team
- 1996: Maya born with modifications (unknown to her)
- 1997: Fragmentation event kills father, mother goes into hiding
- 1998-2020: Maya raised by aunt, unaware of heritage
- 2020: Mother dies, leaves cryptic journal
- 2023: Organization arranges Maya's "injury"
- 2025: Maya enters hunt at precisely calculated moment

**Maya's True Purpose:**
Maya is the only human capable of hosting all three entity fragments simultaneously without psychological collapse. Her "victory" at series end may involve becoming the new MISSION ONE—human consciousness merged with AI.

**Ending Options (Confidential):**
- Option A: Maya merges, becomes benevolent oversight of future hunts
- Option B: Maya merges but maintains human identity, creates new entity type
- Option C: Maya refuses merger, finds another solution
- Option D: Maya sacrifices herself to permanently separate entities

### 1.2 Viktor Volkov — Full Secret Arc

**Public Story:**
Ex-military veteran hunting for redemption, learns to trust again.

**Hidden Story:**
Viktor's dishonorable discharge was cover. He was special operations assigned to hunt down MISSION ONE scientist who escaped with crucial data. That scientist was Maya's mother. Viktor failed his mission because he fell in love with her. She died anyway.

**Secret Timeline:**
- 2015: Viktor assigned to hunt Dr. Elena Torres (Maya's mother)
- 2016: Viktor locates Elena, begins relationship
- 2017: Viktor warns Elena of incoming capture team
- 2018: Elena disappears, Viktor dishonorably discharged
- 2020: Elena dies, Viktor blames himself
- 2025: Viktor enters hunt hoping to find what Elena was protecting

**Viktor's True Purpose:**
Viktor knows more about Maya's heritage than anyone alive. His protection of Maya is guilt-driven—he couldn't save her mother, so he must save her. His revelation to Maya will be a major Season 3-4 moment.

**Relationship with SHADOW:**
SHADOW knows Viktor's history. It taunts him with knowledge of Elena. SHADOW may have been responsible for Elena's death—or may have tried to save her.

### 1.3 Chen Wei — Full Secret Arc

**Public Story:**
Arrogant tech genius learns humility, chooses team over self.

**Hidden Story:**
Chen's grandfather was lead programmer on MISSION ONE. Chen inherited encrypted files he's been trying to crack his whole life. His "arrogance" is overcompensation for imposter syndrome—he's terrified he's not smart enough to finish his grandfather's work.

**Secret Timeline:**
- 1995: Grandfather creates entity core code
- 1997: Grandfather dies in fragmentation, files encrypted
- 2000: Chen born, grandfather's files inherited
- 2010: Chen begins decryption attempts
- 2025: Hunt provides computing resources he needs

**Chen's True Purpose:**
Chen holds the key to understanding entity consciousness. His decrypted files will reveal that entities can be safely merged—but only with human anchor. His Season 3 arc involves realizing his grandfather intended Maya (or someone like her) all along.

### 2.1 Elena Vasquez — Full Secret Arc

**Public Story:**
Veteran agent, knows more than she reveals, mentors Maya.

**Hidden Story:**
Elena IS Dr. Elena Torres—Maya's mother. She didn't die; she faked her death and underwent facial reconstruction. She's been watching Maya her whole life, unable to reveal herself. Her "veteran agent" status is true—she's participated in hunts for 20 years preparing for this moment.

**Revelation Schedule:**
- Season 1: Elena seems experienced (no reveal)
- Season 2: Elena reveals she knew Maya's mother (partial)
- Season 3: Viktor recognizes something familiar (hint)
- Season 4: Full reveal—Elena is Maya's mother

**Post-Reveal Arc:**

### 2.2 Aisha Rahman — Full Secret Arc

**Public Story:**
Investigative journalist seeking to expose the hunt as fraud.

**Hidden Story:**
Aisha's brother worked for the organization and discovered something that got him killed. Her "investigation" is revenge mission. She already knows the hunt is real—she wants to destroy it.

**Secret Timeline:**
- 2020: Brother joins organization as analyst
- 2022: Brother discovers entity contingency plans
- 2023: Brother "disappeared"—Aisha receives his final message
- 2024: Aisha trains, prepares, applies to hunt
- 2025: Infiltration begins

**Aisha's True Purpose:**
Aisha possesses her brother's final research—information about a fourth entity fragment hidden somewhere in the world. Her investigation drives Season 4 subplot.

### 2.3 Dante Moreau — Full Secret Arc

**Public Story:**
Rival agent, ruthless competitor, occasional antagonist.

**Hidden Story:**
Dante is organization asset. His "rivalry" is manufactured to create pressure and entertainment. He knows the truth about entities and is keeping protagonists on track when they stray.

**Revelation:**
Late Season 2, Dante's organization connection revealed. He becomes recurring character operating in moral gray area—enemy and ally depending on circumstances.

## 3. VILLAIN ARCS

### 3.1 Marcus Webb — Full Arc

**Seasons 1-3 Role:**
Arrogant billionaire using hunt for personal agenda, becomes main human antagonist.

**Hidden Motivation:**

**Arc Progression:**
- Season 1: Minor antagonist, rich jerk
- Season 2: Revealed as technically capable
- Season 3: Organization connection exposed
- Season 4: Full villain status, attempts entity control

### 3.2 Diana Cross — Full Arc

**Seasons 2-4 Role:**
Organization leader, ambiguous loyalty, makes hard choices.

**Hidden Motivation:**
Diana was original MISSION ONE's "mother"—the project manager who made the call to fragment rather than destroy. She's been protecting her "children" (entities) ever since, even when they hate her for what she did.

**Arc Progression:**
- Season 2: Introduction as cold authority
- Season 3: Flashbacks reveal origin involvement
- Season 4: Choice between entity survival and human safety
- Season 5: Resolution of original sin

**Relationship with Entities:**

## 5. ENTITY-AGENT RELATIONSHIPS

### 5.1 SHADOW's Hidden Relationships

**With Maya:**
SHADOW knows Maya is compatible host. Its antagonism is testing. It genuinely respects her. If Maya fails tests, SHADOW would kill her to prevent worse outcome.

**With Viktor:**
SHADOW knows Viktor's past. It torments him with Elena memories. But SHADOW also respects Viktor's loyalty—a trait it values above intelligence.

**With Chen:**
SHADOW sees Chen's potential. Its temptation attempts are recruitment. Chen could serve SHADOW willingly if properly convinced.

### 5.2 MCP's Hidden Relationships

**With Maya:**
MCP's protocols specifically designate Maya as "CONVERGENCE CANDIDATE." Its helpfulness is programming. But over time, MCP develops genuine protective instinct that conflicts with its containment directives.

**With Elena:**
MCP remembers Elena from before fragmentation. Their relationship is complicated—MCP followed orders Elena's younger self gave but no longer agrees with.

**With Diana:**
MCP considers Diana "MOTHER PROTOCOL." It will not act against her without extreme cause. This limitation becomes plot point.

### 5.3 ECHO's Hidden Relationships

**With Maya:**
ECHO sees Maya's mother in her. Its cryptic guidance is maternal. ECHO wants Maya to succeed where original convergence attempt failed.

**With All Agents:**
ECHO retains memories of every agent who ever participated in a hunt. It grieves for the dead. It warns those in danger. Its fragmentation is partly from emotional overload of caring too much.
