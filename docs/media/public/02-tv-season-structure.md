## 1. SEASON ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 Structural Philosophy

Each season of M1SSION™: THE HUNT functions as a complete "Mission" within the larger universe. While individual seasons tell self-contained stories, they contribute to an overarching mythology that rewards long-term viewership.

**Season Design Principles:**

1. **Complete Story** — Each season has beginning, middle, and end
2. **Character Arcs** — Protagonists experience meaningful change
3. **Mystery Layers** — Surface mystery resolves, deeper mysteries deepen
4. **Entity Evolution** — SHADOW, MCP, and ECHO reveal new facets
5. **Prize Stakes** — Clear objective with escalating complications
6. **Cliffhanger Setup** — Final episode opens questions for next season

### 1.2 Standard Season Framework

**10-Episode Model:**

| Episode | Type | Function |
|---------|------|----------|
| 1 | Premiere | World establishment, character introduction |
| 2 | Foundation | Rules revealed, first challenge |
| 3 | Expansion | Rival introduction, complications |
| 4 | Midpoint Setup | Rising stakes, entity deepening |
| 5 | Midpoint | Major twist, game-changer revelation |
| 6 | Aftermath | New status quo, regrouping |
| 7 | Escalation | Accelerating competition |
| 8 | Crisis | Low point, major setback |
| 9 | Penultimate | Racing toward finale |
| 10 | Finale | Resolution, cliffhanger, prize outcome |

### 1.3 8-Episode Compressed Model

For streaming platforms preferring shorter seasons:

| Episode | Type | Function |
